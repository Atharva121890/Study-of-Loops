# 🐍 Study of Loops in Python 🔁

## 🎯 Aim
The aim of this repository is to study and understand **loops in Python**, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. Loops help in reducing code repetition and improving efficiency.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- 🖥️ Python Programming Language  
- 📝 Any Code Editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)  
- 📚 Basic understanding of variables and conditional statements

## 📖 Theory

### 🔹 What are Loops? 🤔
Loops are control structures that allow a program to **execute a set of statements multiple times**. They are mainly used when repetition of tasks is required.

Loops make programs shorter, cleaner, and more efficient.

### 🔹 Types of Loops in Python 🔄

#### 1️⃣ for Loop
The **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers.

📌 *Used when the number of iterations is known.*

---

#### 2️⃣ while Loop
The **while loop** executes a block of code **as long as a given condition is true**.

📌 *Used when the number of iterations is not fixed and depends on a condition.*

### 🔹 Loop Control Statements 🛑

#### 🔸 break
The **break statement** is used to immediately exit the loop before it finishes normally.

#### 🔸 continue
The **continue statement** skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

#### 🔸 pass
The **pass statement** is used as a placeholder when no action is required.

### 🔹 Importance of Loops ⭐
- Reduces repetition of code  
- Saves time and effort  
- Makes programs efficient  
- Useful in processing large data sets

## 🔍 Applications of Loops
- Printing patterns  
- Generating tables  
- Searching and sorting operations  
- Menu-driven programs  
- Processing lists and user inputs

## 🏁 Conclusion
Loops are an essential part of Python programming. They allow repetitive execution of statements in a structured way. Understanding loops helps in writing efficient, clean, and logical programs. Mastering loops is important for solving real-world programming problems
